This folder is for the "easy mode" challenges, where the app's Security Level is set to "low". This means that there are no security measures in place at all. You can set this in <b>/dvwa/security.php</b>.

My details are as follows:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Hostname: http://dvwa/</li>
  <li>DVWA directory: /dvwa/</li>
  <li>Full root directory: http://dvwa/dvwa/</li>
</ol>

I'll be listing paths in a relative sense. For example, I will reference the full URL of <b>http://dvwa/dvwa/login.php</b> as <b>/dvwa/login.php</b>. 
<br><br>
Don't forget, there is a help/hint guide for each challenge built into the app. It's always located at the bottom right corner of each challenge's main page. You may need to scroll down to see it. They're well-written and incredibly useful.
<br><br>
If you're having trouble seeing the formatted HTML, please append the following string to your URL: "<b> http://htmlpreview.github.com/?</b>". For example, to see this README in HTML, do: http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/mrudy/dvwa-guide-2019/blob/master/low/README.md
